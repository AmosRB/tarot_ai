      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 12, 2025</p>
      <p><strong><span class="app-name">TAROT AI</span></strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).</p>

        <li><strong>Content You Provide</strong> such as text, images, audio, or other files you upload or generate within the App, strictly for providing the requested features.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Information (if enabled)</strong> to power location‑based features. You can control location permissions in your device settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice/Audio (if applicable)</strong> processed solely to deliver voice features. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, recordings are not stored longer than necessary to provide the feature.</li>

        <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)</h2>
      <p>Where applicable, we process personal data based on: (a) performance of a contract (providing the App), (b) our legitimate interests (e.g., improving services, preventing fraud), (c) your consent (e.g., optional features/permissions), and/or (d) legal obligations.</p>

      <h2>4) Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information. We may share information only with:</p>

      </ul>

      <h2>5) Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We keep personal information only for as long as needed to provide the App and fulfill the purposes described above, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

      <h2>6) Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

      <h2>7) Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

      </ul>

      <h2>9) International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>We may process and store information in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) to protect transferred data.</p>

      <h2>10) Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>The App may link to or integrate third‑party services (e.g., cloud storage, crash reporting, analytics). Your use of those services is governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>
